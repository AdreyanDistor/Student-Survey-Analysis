Project for Data Analysis Methods class. Used various types of data visulizations to understand data, and utilized hypothesis testing to answer our questions 

# Our Data
*  It was provided to us by our teacher after a survey was conducted, and shared with to 100's of different students
## The data we extracted from it 
  * What is your current class standing?
  * What is your gender?
  * What is your GPA?
  * What is your current class standing?
  * What is your major?
  * Why did you choose to major in this field? Select all that apply.
  * What is your favorite area of Computer Science?
  * How many Computer Science related events (e.g., hackathons, programming competitions, etc.) have you been to since Fall 2022?
  * How do you perceive your overall performance in math and science courses?
  * Do you listen to music while you do homework?
  * Which of the following genres do you listen to the majority of the time?
  * How many years have you been involved with music (playing instruments, singing, composing, etc.)?
  * Do you think that the mental processes involved in music (e.g., rhythm, pattern recognition) are related to those in math and science?
  * Do you play an instrument?
  * If you play an instrument, what instrument do you play?
  * What CS-related field do you prefer?
  * What is your least favorite part of Computer Science?
